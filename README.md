## Overview

The Movies Recommendation System aims to:

1. Analyze user ratings and movie metadata to identify trends and preferences.
2. Recommend movies based on user behavior and movie features.
3. Explore multiple recommendation techniques for improved accuracy.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations.
- Support for multiple recommendation techniques:
  - Content-based filtering.
  - Collaborative filtering.
  - Hybrid approaches.
- Interactive data visualization for insights.
- Scalable architecture for large datasets.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing:

- User ratings for movies.
- Movie metadata such as genres, release year, and cast.

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository. Use public datasets like [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) or your dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefelzahar/movies_recommendations.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movies_recommendations
 

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset in the specified format.
2. Preprocess the data using the provided scripts.
3. Run the recommendation algorithms to generate personalized movie lists.
4. Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as precision, recall, and RMSE.

## Recommendation Techniques

The following techniques are implemented:

1. **Content-Based Filtering:**
   - Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked, based on metadata.

2. **Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Leverages user-item interaction data to suggest movies.
   - Includes matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

3. **Hybrid Approaches:**
   - Combines content-based and collaborative methods for enhanced accuracy.

## Results

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Identifies similar movies based on genres and metadata.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Provides personalized recommendations using user behavior.
- **Hybrid Method:** Achieved the best performance, balancing metadata and user interaction.

Evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, Precision, Recall) are detailed in the project notebook.
